This project is done in .NET Core 3.0 using a LocalDb MSSQL database. 
If you don't have both of those set up properly, it may not entirely work.

Upon initial execution, the app will try to create a LocalDb database and populate it with sample job vacancies. 
Again, this step could potentially fail based on your SQL Server configuration.

It builds and executes well on mine.

Kind regards,
